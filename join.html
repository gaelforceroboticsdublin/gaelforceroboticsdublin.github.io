                <h1 class="pagetitle">Joining Gael Force</h1>
                
				<h2 class="bodytitle">The Process</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					1) Apply to join Gael Force Robotics <br>
					2) Join the Gael Force Academy <br>
					3) Attend Academy meetings <br>
					4) Become an intern for a Competitive Team <br>
					5) Join a Competitive Team
				</p>

				<h2 class="bodytitle">Club Application</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					First things first, you need to apply to become a member of GFR. Fill out our 
					<a class="generallink" href="#">application form</a> so we know you're interested. Next, try 
					coming to one of our Tuesday lunch meetings. We will be having weekly meetings during lunch
					(after FMP) in room Q12. You can ask a board member there for more information.
				</p>

				<h2 class="bodytitle">Gael Force Academy</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					If you're completely new to robotics, you'll be joining the Gael Force Academy (hereafter 
					referred to as GFA). GFA is our way of teaching new members that may not be all too familiar 
					with VEX, VRC, or robotics. GFA has meetings after school, twice a week, in portable P5. These 
					meetings typically run from 3:30 to 5:30. They are led by President Josh Koh and Officer Jeff Cheema.
					They often have guest appearances from captains, board members, and competition team members that 
					help teach. GFA will teach you everything you need to know about robotics. Important topics such as
					 build methods, design, VEX terminology, programming, CAD, and many more will all be covered in the
					  curriculum. Check out the 
					  <a class="generallink" href="#">GFA</a> 
					  page for more information about our Academy program. 
				</p>

				<h2 class="bodytitle">Internships</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Internships are an intermediate step between the Academy program and a Competitive Team. After 
					spending a considerable amount of time in the Academy program, learning the basics of Robotics, 
					and showing a willingness to cooperate and dedicate time to robotics, Academy members may be taken 
					as interns by a Competitive Team. As an intern, you will still be an Academy member, however, you 
					will also be attending the meetings of a competitive team in order to gain further experience and 
					knowledge. In addition, this will serve as the team’s way of assessing if you are compatible with 
					their team dynamic, and will be asked to join the team if they do choose to add you.
